# BASH

A collection of my bash scripts

Finished:
- newuser.sh - A simple script automating creation of new user account and assigning them to groups.

Ideas To-do:
- A script that prompts the user for a name and then prints a personalized greeting.
- A script that calculates and displays the result of a basic arithmetic operation (e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- A script that takes a file as input and counts the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.
- A script that generates a random password and displays it to the user.
- A script that checks the disk space usage on the system and sends an email alert if the usage exceeds a certain threshold.
- A script that backs up a specified directory to a remote location (e.g. a remote server or cloud storage service).
- A script that checks the system logs for error messages and sends an email alert if any are found.
- A script that monitors a remote server and sends an email alert if the server goes down.
- A script that converts a file from one format to another (e.g. CSV to JSON or vice versa).
- A script that generates a simple HTML page with a specified title and body text.
